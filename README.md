Synchronizes your subtitles from your subtitle files the way you like it to be

subtitle_fixer.py [subtitle file] [delay/hasten] [desired time in seconds]  
[subtitle file] - your subtitle file  
[delay/hasten] - just the word "delay" or "hasten", the way you want your subtitles to be  
[desired time in seconds] - your desired time in seconds to delay it or hasten it  

You can use this multiple times without corrupting or missing your subtitle file cause this script is designed to keep a backup and if found, that will be the script's base file for synchronization
